# LinkedStateRouting
Developed a project which simulates the real Link State Routing algorithm. Initially, the state of the network is set up. The routers then flood link state packets to find out if the packets from a particular router are reachable to the other routers in the network based on the packet's Time to Live factor. Based on this information, the routing table for each router is calculated using Dijkstra's algorithm. The project also demonstrates the failure of routers and bringing the router back up. In case of such network change, routers would repeat the process to bring that change to effect by rerouting the path.
